Spirals
=======

A simple application in C# that allows the user to draw spirals. The primary reason this application exists is simply to demo a DrawSpiral method that I created, so the user has full control over the spiral that is drawn. All of the arguments passed to the function are edited from the GUI by the user.

If you want to use any of the code in this application, go for it... just don't be a dick.

     Being a dick includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:

   1a. Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy this and change the name.  
   1b. Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever, that's REALLY being a dick.  
	 1c. Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That would make you a PROPER dick.  

 2. If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work,
 share the love. Only a dick would make loads off this work and not buy the original works 
 creator(s) a pint.
 
 3. Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and bitching when it goes wrong makes 
 you a DONKEY dick. Fix the problem yourself. A non-dick would submit the fix back.
